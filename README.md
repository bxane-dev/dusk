# Dusk

Dusk is a local-first Windows game launcher built with Tauri, Rust, React, TypeScript, and SQLite.

**Current version: 1.8.4**

It scans real local game installations, launches games, tracks sessions it can observe, and keeps the library database on the user's PC. Dusk does not ship with fake games or seeded playtime.

## Cloud-synced hours played (v1.8.0)

Signed-in users' hours played and launch counts are synchronized to Supabase.
Dusk imports prior 1.7.x cloud totals once, then uploads distinct play sessions
identified by device and local session ID. Devices merge recorded totals without
deleting other devices' sessions; offline play is uploaded when cloud access
returns. Local game executable paths stay on the PC.

Guest accounts remain local-only. Session duration is counted only when Dusk
can observe the launched process. Sync runs automatically when refreshing the
library and periodically while online.

## Online-Fix browser click repair and ad blocking (v1.8.3)

The isolated in-app Online-Fix browser now opens trusted Hosters and Drive
`target="_blank"` links in the current Dusk download window. A lightweight
ad/content filter hides recognizable advertisements, strips known ad embeds and
blocks known ad-network link clicks. Native navigation and popup handlers deny
external redirects and new ad windows. It also tries to hide adult-content
advertising loaded on the game listings, without blocking official game links.

This protects **Dusk's in-app Online-Fix browser only**, not other apps,
a normal web browser, or every ad request. It is not a full system-wide
network ad blocker. Third-party download hosts not explicitly allowed in Dusk
can still be opened using the external browser fallback.

## Automatic archive link selection (v1.8.2)

**Get game** now opens the listed game's Online-Fix Drive source and enables a
conservative auto-selector in a separate, isolated Dusk window. When the host
makes ordinary game archive links available, Dusk selects matching ZIP, RAR,
and 7z parts, and saves supported WebView downloads into the user's standard
Downloads directory. The existing download watcher imports files after they
have completed.

Dusk does not click advertisements, complete content-locker tasks, bypass
authentication, or guess URLs. Some hosts hide downloads behind JavaScript,
redirects, or unsupported file listings; in those cases finish the site's steps
or select the download manually. The auto-selector only runs on exact official
Drive and Hosters domains, and it ignores fixes, updates, unrelated filenames,
and unsafe files. Auto-selection is best-effort and may require the external
browser fallback if the site rejects embedded browsing.

**Online-Fix Drive is the default for full games.** Hosters may offer only
fixes and updates. Use Hosters only when the page clearly offers the full game.

## Selecting the correct full-game download (v1.8.1)

In the Online-Fix search results, **Get game** examines the selected listing's
game-content section and identifies the actual full-game links. It selects
the **Online-Fix Hosters** mirror first and shows the **Online-Fix Drive**
mirror as another choice. These URLs are checked against exact source hosts;
fix-only downloads, torrents and unrelated advertisements are never selected
as the standard game download.

Select the preferred source and complete any required authentication,
download-host interaction or download in the site. Dusk then monitors
the standard Downloads folder for an archive whose filename matches
the selected game, instead of importing unrelated recent downloads.
Installers are still launched only after the user confirms.

## In-app game discovery and managed archive import

Dusk has an **Online-Fix** search toggle beside the library search box. Search
results appear inside Dusk, and **Open in Dusk** opens the selected listing in
an isolated webview window. **Browser fallback** uses your normal browser if
a third-party download host does not work in the embedded window.

Opening a listing starts a **two-hour download monitor**. While Dusk is open,
it checks the current Windows user's `Downloads` folder for new, completed
ZIP, RAR, and 7z archives. It waits for file size to stabilize before attempting
automatic import. Multipart archives are supported when all parts are available
in the same folder; the first `.part1.rar` or `.7z.001` file starts extraction.
If you download to a different folder, use **Import archive** and pick the file
manually.

Archives are extracted into `<Dusk app data>/managed-games/<game>-<id>`.
Dusk prefers an installed **7-Zip** executable; on Windows ZIPs also have
a PowerShell/.NET fallback. An installed **Python 3** interpreter provides
another fallback: ZIP needs only the standard library, 7z needs `py7zr`,
and RAR needs `rarfile` and an extraction backend such as `unrar`.
For monitored Online-Fix downloads, the documented archive password is
used automatically. Dusk rejects unsafe archive paths and symlinks and applies
a 20 GiB / 50,000-entry extraction limit.

If the archive contains exactly one plausible portable-game executable, Dusk
adds it directly to the library. For installers, Dusk requires an explicit
confirmation before executing any installer, and it does not bypass Windows
security prompts. Multiple possible executables require manual selection.

**Limitations:** Third-party sites may require user actions, login, an ad
unlock, or a torrent client before any archive exists in Downloads.
Dusk does not bypass these steps, download arbitrary gated files, or
automatically execute untrusted programs. The monitor only runs while Dusk
is open.

## Run in development

Requirements:

- Node.js
- Rust stable
- Windows WebView2 / Tauri Windows prerequisites

Commands:

    npm install
    npm run tauri dev

## Build the Windows installer

    npm install
    npm run tauri build

The Tauri config targets an NSIS Windows installer. The official logo source is the coded `src/assets/dusk-logo.svg`. `scripts/prepare-brand.ps1` renders matching vector geometry into the multi-resolution Windows ICO and NSIS installer artwork before development and release builds.

## Data

Dusk stores its SQLite database, copied cover images, and imported screenshots in the Tauri application data directory for dev.bxane.dusk.

Playtime is only recorded for sessions Dusk can actually track. If a Steam game's executable cannot be detected, Dusk can still request the Steam launch but explicitly reports that the session cannot be counted.

## Automatic detection

Current scanners:

- Steam
- Epic Games
- GOG
- Common emulator installations

Detected emulators are added as launchable library entries. ROM-specific launching will be handled separately; any other Windows game can still be added manually by selecting its executable.

## Screenshot detection

Dusk automatically checks:

- Steam userdata screenshot folders and matches them by Steam App ID
- Common `Screenshots` / `Captures` folders inside known game install directories
- `Pictures\Screenshots`
- `Videos\Captures` used by Xbox Game Bar

For shared Windows folders, Dusk only imports an image when the filename contains a sufficiently specific known game title. Imported source paths are tracked so repeated scans do not create duplicates. If an automatically found screenshot is removed from Dusk, its original source file is left untouched and Dusk remembers not to re-import it automatically.

## Dusk accounts, owner profiles, and Supabase cloud saves

Dusk uses Supabase-backed accounts. Registration uses email, username, and password; normal sign-in uses username and password. Each account can contain multiple owner profiles, and each owner has a separate visible game library, save-folder configuration, and backup set.

When Supabase cloud saves are configured, Dusk uploads the **actual save files** from each backup to the private `dusk-savefiles` Storage bucket. The object structure is:

```text
<supabase-user-uuid>/
  profiles/<profile-id>/
    games/<game-id>/
      backups/<backup-id>/
        <original relative save-file paths>
        _backup.json
```

Dusk also syncs account-owned metadata including profiles, library membership, favorites, playtime, launch counts, collections, and the active profile. Executable paths and save-folder paths remain device-local so a second PC never inherits invalid filesystem locations. Local backups remain usable if cloud access is temporarily unavailable.

Cloud setup requires:

- the Dusk Supabase project URL
- the Dusk Supabase publishable key
- the private bucket/RLS policies in `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`

Only a publishable key is used in the desktop client. A Supabase `service_role` or secret key must never be embedded in Dusk.

## Owner profile save files

Each local owner profile can keep its own physical copy of a game's actual save files.

For every configured game, Dusk stores the active owner's current copy under:

`<Dusk app data>/profiles/<profile-id>/games/<game-id>/current/`

The game detail panel provides:

- **Save to profile** — copies the live game save folder into the active owner's physical vault.
- **Load profile files** — creates a safety backup of the current live saves, then replaces them with that owner's stored files.
- File count, total size, and last-updated information.

Choosing a save folder seeds the owner's vault with the current live files. Creating a normal manual backup also refreshes that owner's current vault.

Profile deletion removes that owner's Dusk-managed vault and backup copies, but never deletes the game's live save folder.

## Save-game backups

Save backups are opt-in per game. Dusk does not guess save locations.

From a game's details panel:

1. Choose the exact save folder used by that game.
2. Create a restore point with **Back up now**.
3. Review backup time, file count, and size.
4. Restore any snapshot when needed.
5. Delete old Dusk snapshots without changing the live save folder.

Before every restore, Dusk first creates a `pre-restore` safety backup of the current saves. Restore operations replace the contents of the configured save folder with the selected snapshot.

Dusk rejects drive roots and broad Windows, Program Files, user-profile, and AppData roots as backup targets. Backups stay local under Dusk's application data directory.

## Controller and console mode

Dusk supports standard gamepads through the browser Gamepad API used by the Tauri webview.

Default controls:

- D-pad / left stick: move focus
- A / Cross: select the focused control
- X / Square: launch the focused game card
- B / Circle: go back / close the current panel
- Menu / Start: toggle fullscreen console mode
- F11: keyboard shortcut for console mode

Console mode switches the Tauri window into native fullscreen, collapses Dusk to an icon rail, increases card sizing and focus visibility, and shows an on-screen controller hint bar. The setting is stored locally.

## CI and releases

GitHub Actions checks the React build and Rust code on Windows.

The Windows release workflow can be started manually from GitHub Actions or from the dedicated `installer-build` branch. It publishes a stable NSIS installer. If updater-signing and Windows certificate secrets are configured, the same workflow also publishes signed updater artifacts and Authenticode-signs the Windows build.

## Stable release

Stable installers are published on GitHub Releases:

- Repository: https://github.com/bxanedot/dusk
- Releases: https://github.com/bxanedot/dusk/releases
- Changelog: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Signing setup: `RELEASE_SIGNING.md`

The release workflow never commits private signing material. Missing signing secrets cause the corresponding signing layer to be skipped rather than fabricated.

### Windows process identity

Dusk installs and appears to users as **Dusk**, but the Windows process binary is **DuskLauncher.exe**. This avoids using the generic `dusk.exe` process name that Discord can falsely auto-detect as a game.
